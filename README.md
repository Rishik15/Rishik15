# Hi there, I'm Rishik ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
I'm passionate about technology, coding, and building awesome things.

## About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Rishik. Iâ€™m a junior at NJIT working toward a career in machine learning. I first got into it during my freshman year while exploring different areas in tech, and it quickly became something I knew I wanted to pursue seriously. Over the past two years, Iâ€™ve focused on building a strong foundation in data analysis, model development, and real-world problem solving.

Right now, Iâ€™m involved in academic research thatâ€™s helped me apply machine learning concepts to real world problems. I enjoy breaking down complex ideas, figuring out how things work, and turning that into something useful. Outside that, Iâ€™m probably reading a book or collecting bad dad jokes.

Iâ€™m currently looking for opportunities where I can apply machine learning in a real world setting, grow as an engineer, and contribute to meaningful projects. Feel free to reach out or check out my GitHub or Portfolio to see some of what Iâ€™ve worked on.
